# Context sampler configuration (Hydra stub).
#
# The time-equivalent sampler can draw at most one aligned window per symbol.
# Training/inference pipelines must set `effective_C = min(desired_sequences,
# len(symbols_with_history(target_date, target_length)))` before calling
# `sample_time_equivalent` to avoid runtime ValueErrors.
